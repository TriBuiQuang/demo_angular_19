<h2 class="title-theme__h2">Angular 18</h2>
<h3>
	released on May 22, 2024, introduced several significant features and improvements aimed at
	enhancing developer experience and application performance.
</h3>

<h4>Key Features:</h4>

<h5>1. Experimental Zoneless Change Detection</h5>
<h5>2. Stable Material 3 Components</h5>
<h5>3. Deferrable Views and Built-in Control Flow</h5>
<h5>4. Introduction of &#64;let Syntax</h5>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<h5>
	Performance Improvements: The introduction of zoneless change detection offers potential
	performance gains by eliminating the overhead associated with zone.js. The shift towards zoneless
	change detection and deferrable views can lead to improved application performance and reduced
	bundle sizes.
</h5>
<h5>
	Simplified Templates: The new control flow and &#64;defer syntaxes streamline template logic,
	making code more readable and maintainable.
</h5>
<h5>
	Enhanced Developer Resources: The revamped documentation site provides a more intuitive and
	resource-rich environment for developers.
</h5>

<h4>Cons</h4>
<h5>
	Experimental Features: The zoneless change detection is still experimental, which may pose risks
	if adopted in production environments without thorough testing.
</h5>
<h5>
	Learning Curve: Adopting new syntaxes and features may require developers to invest time in
	learning and refactoring existing codebases.
</h5>

<br />
<p>
	In summary, Angular 18 brings forward-thinking features that enhance performance and developer
	experience. However, cautious adoption and thorough testing are advisable, especially concerning
	experimental functionalities.

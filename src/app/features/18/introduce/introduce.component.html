	<h2 class="title-theme__h2">Angular 18</h2>
	<p>
		Released on May 22, 2024, introduced several significant features and improvements aimed at
		enhancing developer experience and application performance.
	</p>

	<p-fieldset legend="Key Features:">
		<p>1. Experimental Zoneless Change Detection</p>
		<p>2. Stable Material 3 Components</p>
		<p>3. Deferrable Views and Built-in Control Flow</p>
		<p>4. Introduction of &#64;let Syntax</p>
	</p-fieldset>

	<p-fieldset legend="Pros">
		<p>
			- Performance Improvements: The introduction of zoneless change detection offers potential
			performance gains by eliminating the overhead associated with zone.js. The shift towards
			zoneless change detection and deferrable views can lead to improved application performance
			and reduced bundle sizes.
		</p>
		<p>
			- Simplified Templates: The new control flow and &#64;defer syntaxes streamline template
			logic, making code more readable and maintainable.
		</p>
		<p>
			- Enhanced Developer Resources: The revamped documentation site provides a more intuitive
			and resource-rich environment for developers.
		</p>
	</p-fieldset>

	<p-fieldset legend="Cons">
		<p>
			- Experimental Features: The zoneless change detection is still experimental, which may
			pose risks if adopted in production environments without thorough testing.
		</p>
		<p>
			- Learning Curve: Adopting new syntaxes and features may require developers to invest time
			in learning and refactoring existing codebases.
		</p>
	</p-fieldset>

	<br />
	<p>
		====> In summary, Angular 18 brings forward-thinking features that enhance performance and
		developer experience. However, cautious adoption and thorough testing are advisable,
		especially concerning experimental functionalities.
